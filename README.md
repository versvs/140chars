140 chars
=========
A simple webextension to filter out of your timeline all tweets that have more than 140 characters.

This extension is more of a toy than a real project, but maybe there is room of improvement to actually do something useful with it. For starters, if you want to write a real, long message and the 140 char is putting pressure on you, try opening a blog instead :P

About the author
================
Jose Alc√°ntara (@versvs at Twitter). But I also have a blog (http://www.versvs.net) with posts that couldnt be cut down to 140 chars (or less).


To Do
=====
Use MutationObservers to check the load of new tweets instead of this every-few-seconds trick we do now.
