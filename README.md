140 chars
=========
A simple webextension to filter out of your timeline all tweets that have more than 140 characters.

This extension is more of a toy than a real project, but maybe there is room of improvement to actually do something useful with it. For starters, if you want to write a real, long message and the 140 char is putting pressure on you, try opening a blog instead :P
